%COSTM  Cost mapping, classification using costs
%
%   Y = COSTM(X,C,LABLIST)
%   W = COSTM([],C,LABLIST)
%
% DESCRIPTION
% Maps the classifier output X (assumed to be posterior probability
% estimates) to the cost-outputs, defined by the cost-matrix C:
%
%   C(i,j) = cost of misclassifying an object from class i as class j.
%
% Default C is the cost matrix stored in the dataset X.
% The order of the classes is defined by LABLIST. When no lablist is
% given, the order as given by GETFEATLAB(X) is assumed.
% In order to apply this mapping, it is assumed that the dataset X
% represents posterior class probabilities (i.e. normalized by
% classc).
%
% EXAMPLE
% x = gendatb(100);
% w1 = x*ldc;                  % standard classifier
% C = [0 2; 1 0];              % new cost matrix
% w2 = w1*classc*costm([],C);  % classifier using this cost-matrix
