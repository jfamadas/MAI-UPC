%
% INPUT	
%   A     Dataset
%   CRIT  String name of the criterion or untrained mapping 
%         (optional; default: 'NN', i.e. 1-Nearest Neighbor error)
%   K     Number of features to select 
%         (optional; default: return optimally ordered set of all features)
%   T     Tuning set (optional)
%   N     Number of cross-validations
%   FID   File ID to write progress to (default [], see PRPROGRESS)
%
% OUTPUT
%   W     Output feature selection mapping
%   R     Matrix with step-by-step results of the selection
%
% DESCRIPTION
% Backward selection of K features using the dataset A. CRIT sets the 
% criterion used by the feature evaluation routine FEATEVAL. If the  
% dataset T is given, it is used as test set for FEATEVAL. Alternatvely a
% a number of cross-validation N may be supplied. For K = 0, the optimal 
% feature set (corresponding to the maximum value of FEATEVAL) is returned. 
% The result W can be used for selecting features by B*W. In this case, 
% features are ranked optimally. 
% The selected features are stored in W.DATA and can be found by +W.
% In R, the search is reported step by step as:
% 
% 	R(:,1) : number of features
% 	R(:,2) : criterion value
% 	R(:,3) : added / deleted feature

		%the features:

		% understand what is happening in there)
		dim = size(a,2);
