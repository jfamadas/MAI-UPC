%
% INPUT
%   A    Dataset or datafile for defining histogram bins (training)
%   N    Scalar defining number of histogram bins (default 10)
%   B    Dataset or datafile to be transformed into a histogram with
%        predifined bins.
%   X    User defined histogram bins (centers)
%
% OUTPUT
%   C    Dataset or datafile with histogram bin frequencies
%
% DESCRIPTION
% For every object in the dataset B the set of feature values is mapped
% into a histogram, specifying for each bin the number of features having a
% value as specified for that bin. This is particular useful if the objects
% are images and the features are pixels. In that case for every image a
% histogram is found.
%
% The dataset A may be used to find the proper histogram bins. In that case
% histograms with N bins are constructed between the minimum and maximum
% values over all objects in A.
%
% Formally HISTM([],N) is an untrained mapping, to be trained by A as the 
% dataset (datafile) A is used to determine the histogram bin centers. 
% In case the bins are given like in HISTM(B,X) then we have a trained mapping.
% Consequently, if A is a datafile then in C = A*HISTM(A,10) all objects in
% A are processed twice. Once for determining the bin positions and once for
% filling them. If appropriate a command like C = A*HISTM(A(1,:),10) is
% thereby significantly faster, as it determines the bin positions by just
% a single object.
