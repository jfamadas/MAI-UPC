% INPUT
%   A      Image
%   N      Number of images on a row
%   B      Intensity value of background (default 0.5);

% OUTPUT 
%   H      Graphics handle

% DESCRIPTION
% PRTools offers a SHOW command for variables of the data classes DATASET
% and DATAFILE. In order to have a simliar command for images not converted
% to a DATASET this commands made availble. A should be 2D, 3D or 4D image.
%
% 2D images are fully displayed.
%
% 3D images are converted to a dataset with as many feature images as given
% in the 3rd dimension and displayed by DATASET/SHOW.
%
% 4D images with 3 bands in the 3rd dimension are converted to a dataset with 
% as many 3-color object images as are given in the 4th dimension and
% displayed by DATASET/SHOW
%
% All other 4D images are converted to a dataset with as many 2D feature
% images as given by the dimensions 3 and 4 and displayed by DATASET/SHOW.
% Unless given otherwise, N is set to size(A,3).
