%FEATSEL Selection of known features
%
%   [W,V] = FEATSEL(K,J)
%
% INPUT
%   K    Input dimensionality
%   J    Index vector of features to be selected
%
% OUTPUT
%   W    Mapping performing the feature selection
%   V    Mapping selecting the complementing features 
%
% DESCRIPTION
% This is a simple support routine that writes feature selection
% in terms of a mapping. If A is a K-dimensional dataset and J are
% the feature indices to be selected, then B = A*W does the same as
% B = A(:,J).
%
% The use of this routine is a mapping V computed for a lower dimensional
% subspace defined by J can now be defined by W = FEATSEL(K,J)*V as a 
% mapping in the original K-dimensional space.
%
% The selected features can be retrieved by W.DATA or by +W.
% See below for various methods to perform feature selection.
