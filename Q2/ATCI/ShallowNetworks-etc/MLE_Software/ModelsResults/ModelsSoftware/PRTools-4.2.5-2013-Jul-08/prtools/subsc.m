%SUBSC Subspace Classifier
%
%   W = SUBSC(A,N)
%   W = SUBSC(A,FRAC)
%
% INPUT
%   A          Dataset
%   N or FRAC  Desired model dimensionality or fraction of retained 
%              variance per class
%
% OUTPUT
%   W          Subspace classifier  
%
% DESCRIPTION
% Each class in the trainingset A is described by linear subspace of
% dimensionality N, or such that at least a fraction FRAC of its variance
% is retained. This is realised by calling PCA(AI,N) or PCA(AI,FRAC) for
% each subset AI of A (objects of class I). For each class a model is
% built that assumes that the distances of the objects to the class
% subspaces follow a one-dimensional distribution. 
%
% New objects are assigned to the class of the nearest subspace.
% Classification by D = B*W, in which W is a trained subspace classifier
% and B is a testset, returns a dataset D with one-dimensional densities
% for each of the classes in its columns.
%
% If N (ALF) is NaN it is optimised by REGOPTC.
