# Skeleton for the MAS practical work

This is the practical work skeleton for the subject "MultiAgent Systems" (MAS)
performed in Universitat Rovira i Virgili.


# Goal

Build a skeleton from where students are asked to design and develop
a multi agent system performing several tasks, with communication as
the main cooperation mechanism.


# Scenario

This exercise aims to simulate an efficient manufacturing of metals
on a countryside. There are two kinds of entities: (i) prospectors,
that detects where the metal is, and (ii) diggers that are responsible
digging metal up and disposing it on manufacturing centers.

To make it easy, the game will run in simulation steps. All necessary
communication is expected to be performed in every single simulation step


# Content

This project has a NetBeans project content to make it easy to start
with. To build the multi agent system, we use JADE.

There are two run profiles:

1. Run the multi agent system, showing up the map in 2D.
1. Run the game settings builder.

You can build your running scripts starting with those profiles.

# Authors

* Other teachers build the first skeleton.
* Based on that, the current version was revisited by:
 * Jordi Pujol Ahull√≥ <jordi.pujol@urv.cat>, Universitat Rovira i Virgili.
